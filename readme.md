# Desafios edabit

- 001- How Edabit Works:
  _(This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:)_
- 002 - Power Calculator:
  _Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.Examples: circuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300, circuitPower(110, 3) ➞ 330, circuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600. Notes: Requires basic calculation of electrical circuits (see Resources for info)._
