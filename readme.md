# Desafios edabit

- 001- How Edabit Works:
  _(This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:)_
- 002 - Power Calculator:
  _Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.Examples: circuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300, circuitPower(110, 3) ➞ 330, circuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600. Notes: Requires basic calculation of electrical circuits (see Resources for info)._
- 003 - Return the Sum of Two Numbers:
  _Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Examples: addition(3, 2) ➞ 5, addition(-3, -6) ➞ -9, addition(7, 3) ➞ 10. Notes:Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._
- 004 - Return the Next Number from the Integer Passed: 
_Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result. Examples: addition(0) ➞ 1, addition(9) ➞ 10, addition(-3) ➞ -2. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 005 - Return the First Element in an Array: 
_Create a function that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element. Examples: getFirstValue([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 1, getFirstValue([80, 5, 100]) ➞ 80, getFirstValue([-500, 0, 50]) ➞ -500. Notes: The first element in an array always has an index of 0._

- 006 - Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle:
_Create a function that takes length and width and finds the perimeter of a rectangle. Examples: findPerimeter(6, 7) ➞ 26, findPerimeter(20, 10) ➞ 60, findPerimeter(2, 9) ➞ 22. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you're stuck, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, find solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 007 - Convert Minutes into Seconds: 
_Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds. Examples: convert(5) ➞ 300, convert(3) ➞ 180, convert(2) ➞ 120. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 008 - Buggy Code (Part 1): 
_Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do. Examples: cubes(3) ➞ 27, cubes(5) ➞ 125, cubes(10) ➞ 1000. Notes: READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!, Don't overthink this challenge; it's not supposed to be hard._
