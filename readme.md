# Desafios edabit

- 001- How Edabit Works:
  _(This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:)_
- 002 - Power Calculator:
  _Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.Examples: circuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300, circuitPower(110, 3) ➞ 330, circuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600. Notes: Requires basic calculation of electrical circuits (see Resources for info)._
- 003 - Return the Sum of Two Numbers:
  _Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Examples: addition(3, 2) ➞ 5, addition(-3, -6) ➞ -9, addition(7, 3) ➞ 10. Notes:Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._
- 004 - Return the Next Number from the Integer Passed:
  _Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result. Examples: addition(0) ➞ 1, addition(9) ➞ 10, addition(-3) ➞ -2. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 005 - Return the First Element in an Array:
  _Create a function that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element. Examples: getFirstValue([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 1, getFirstValue([80, 5, 100]) ➞ 80, getFirstValue([-500, 0, 50]) ➞ -500. Notes: The first element in an array always has an index of 0._

- 006 - Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle:
  _Create a function that takes length and width and finds the perimeter of a rectangle. Examples: findPerimeter(6, 7) ➞ 26, findPerimeter(20, 10) ➞ 60, findPerimeter(2, 9) ➞ 22. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you're stuck, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, find solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 007 - Convert Minutes into Seconds:
  _Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds. Examples: convert(5) ➞ 300, convert(3) ➞ 180, convert(2) ➞ 120. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 008 - Buggy Code (Part 1):
  _Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do. Examples: cubes(3) ➞ 27, cubes(5) ➞ 125, cubes(10) ➞ 1000. Notes: READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!, Don't overthink this challenge; it's not supposed to be hard._

- 009 - Correct the Mistakes:
  _Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do. Examples: squared(5) ➞ 25, squared(9) ➞ 81, squared(100) ➞ 10000. Notes: READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!, Don't overthink this challenge; it's not supposed to be hard._

- 010 - Convert Age to Days:
  _Create a function that takes the age in years and returns the age in days. Examples: calcAge(65) ➞ 23725, calcAge(0) ➞ 0, calcAge(20) ➞ 7300. Notes: Use 365 days as the length of a year for this challenge. Ignore leap years and days between last birthday and now. Expect only positive integer inputs._

- 011 - Less Than 100?:
  _Given two numbers, return true if the sum of both numbers is less than 100. Otherwise return false. Examples: lessThan100(22, 15) ➞ true, // 22 + 15 = 37, lessThan100(83, 34) ➞ false, // 83 + 34 = 117, lessThan100(3, 77) ➞ true_

- 012 - Convert Hours into Seconds:
  _Write a function that converts hours into seconds. Examples: howManySeconds(2) ➞ 7200, howManySeconds(10) ➞ 36000, howManySeconds(24) ➞ 86400. Notes: 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, Don't forget to return your answer._

- 013 - Is the Number Less than or Equal to Zero?: 
_Create a function that takes a number as its only argument and returns true if it's less than or equal to zero, otherwise return false. Examples: lessThanOrEqualToZero(5) ➞ false, lessThanOrEqualToZero(0) ➞ true, lessThanOrEqualToZero(-2) ➞ true. Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab._

- 014 - Basketball Points: 
_You are counting points for a basketball game, given the amount of 2-pointers scored and 3-pointers scored, find the final points for the team and return that value. Examples: points(1, 1) ➞ 5, , points(7, 5) ➞ 29, points(38, 8) ➞ 100_

 - 015 - Return Something to Me!: 
_Write a function that returns the string "something" joined with a space " " and the given argument a. Examples: giveMeSomething("is better than nothing") ➞ "something is better than nothing", giveMeSomething("Bob Jane") ➞ "something Bob Jane", giveMeSomething("something") ➞ "something something"_
